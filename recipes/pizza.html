    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with
        tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple,
        meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is
        sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.
    </p>
    <p> In Italy, pizza served in formal settings, such as at a restaurant, is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the
        use of a knife and fork.[2][3] In casual settings, however, it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the
        hand.
