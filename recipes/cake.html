    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cake is a form of sweet food made from flour, sugar, and other ingredients, that is usually baked. In their
        oldest forms, cakes were modifications of bread, but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that can be
        simple or elaborate, and that share features with other desserts such as pastries, meringues, custards, and
        pies.
    </p>
    <p> The most commonly used cake ingredients include flour, sugar, eggs, butter or oil or margarine, a liquid, and a
        leavening agent, such as baking soda or baking powder. Common additional ingredients and flavourings include
        dried, candied, or fresh fruit, nuts, cocoa, and extracts such as vanilla, with numerous substitutions for the
        primary ingredients. Cakes can also be filled with fruit preserves, nuts or dessert sauces (like pastry cream),
        iced with buttercream or other icings, and decorated with marzipan, piped borders, or candied fruit.[1]
