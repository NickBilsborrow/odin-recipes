    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>lasagne is a type of pasta madeof very wide, flat sheets. Either term can also refer to an Italian dish made of
        stacked layers of lasagne alternating with fillings such as rag√π (ground meats and tomato sauce), vegetables,
        cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan), and seasonings and spices, like Italian
        seasoning, such as garlic, oregano and basil.
    </p>
    <p> The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted after baking. Typically, cooked pasta is
        assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven. The resulting casserole is cut into
        single-serving square portions.
